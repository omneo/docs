# Omneo Loyalty Engine
Welcome to the Omneo API documentation - here you can learn about all API calls and methods, what they are for, and how they are used.

## Media Types
Where applicable this API uses the [JSON](json.md) media-type to represent resources states and affordances.

Requests with a message-body are using plain JSON to set or update resource states.

## Error States
The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.

## Support

If you have any questions about this API specification, please contact Omneo Support by sending an email to [support@omneo.io](mailto:support@omneo.io?subject=Omneo+Loyalty+API+V2+Support)

# Authentication
```javascript
const omneo = require('omneo');

let api = omneo.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

**Omneo Loyalty Engine** uses OAuth Authorization using the client credentials grant type. Tokens are created by Omneo and provided to third parties. After you have acquired your token you can use it to access other resources within token's scope.

Information about obtaining an access token can be found in the **Authorization** endpoint documentation.

Omneo expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

## Scopes
